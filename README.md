# AlsavoCtrl
 Alsavo Heat Pump control application

This command-line tool can be used to control pool heat pumps manufactured by Zealux (rebranded as Swim&Fun etc), replacing the "Alsavo Pro" Android/iOS application. Only tested on one specific heat pump; use at your own risk.

# Building from sources

The example build system uses cmake, at least version 3.10. In addition you'll need a C++ compiler (for example g++) installed.

Clone the repository in a directory, and from that directory, run the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After those commands you should have a 'AlsavoCtrl' executable in the build dir.

# Docker image

The included Docker image can be used to create an image that publishes the status and configurable values to MQTT using the Homie 4.0 convention. Based on Peter Haislund's Docker image.

Alternatively, Peter Haislund has created a readymade [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/peterhaislund/alsavo_status) that can be used to publish the status values to MQTT. 


# Usage
```
Usage: AlsavoCtrl [OPTIONS] [conf_idx] [value]

Positionals:
  conf_idx INT                Config index to write
  value INT                   Value to write

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  -s,--serial TEXT REQUIRED   Serial number string of the heat pump
  -l,--password TEXT REQUIRED Password
  -a,--address TEXT           Override server address, defaults to 47.254.157.150
  -p,--port INT               Override server port, default 51194
  --listen                    Keep listening for status updates
  -g,--logfile TEXT           Write log to file
  --json                      Output in more easily parseable JSON format
  ```

Running AlsavoCtrl without config_idx and value will query the current status and config values as JSON and exit.

Status params:

Values are signed int16s.
All temperature values are in tenths of a Celsius, for example a value of -123 means -12.3 degrees C.

16 = Water in temp
17 = Water out temp
18 = Ambient temperature
19 = "Cold pipe temperature"
20 = "Heating pipe temperature"
21 = IPM module temperature
22 = Fan speed (RPM)
23 = Exhaust temperature
24 = Compressor input temperature? Always zero for me.
25 = Electronic exhaust valve opening setting, Range: 0-450'ish
26 = Compressor current in amps
27 = Compressor running frequency
33 = Compressor speed setting (0 = off, 1 = P1 40Hz, 5 = P5 82Hz)
34 = Frequency limit code
48 = Alarm code 1
49 = Alarm code 2
50 = Alarm code 3
51 = Alarm code 4
52 = System status code (0 in heating operation)
53 = System running code (3 = heating operation, 2 = defrost)
54 = Device status code (231 = heating operation, 175 = defrost)
55 = Heating max temperature
56 = Cooling min temperature
64 = Device type
65 = Main board HW revision
66 = Main board SW revision
67 = Manual HW code
68 = Manual SW code

Config params:

1 = Heating mode target temp
2 = Cooling mode target temp
3 = Auto mode target temp
4 = System config bitmask 1 (See below)
5 = System config bitmask 2 (See below)
6 = Manual frequency setting
7 = Manual EEV setting
8 = Manual fan speed setting
9 = Defrost in temp
10 = Defrost out temp (Heating pipe temperature required to end defrost)
11 = Water temperature calibration (offset for all temperature measurements)
12 = Defrost in time (minimum time between defrost sequences, in minutes)
13 = Defrost out time (max defrost time?)
14 = "Hot over", looks like temperature, but without x10? Default value 30
15 = "Cold over" default -20
16 = Power mode (0 = silent, 1 = smart 2 = powerful)
17 = Unknown, default value 6
32 = Current time, hibyte=hours, lobyte=minutes
33 = Timer on time
34 = Timer off time

Sys config 1:

Bits 0-1:   Operating mode: 0 = cool, 1 = heat, 2 = Auto
Bit 2:      Timer on enabled
Bit 3:      Water pump running mode (see manual, 0 = heat pump controls water pump, 1 = always on)
Bit 4:      Electronic Valve style ?
Bit 5:      On/off
Bit 6:      Debug mode (0 = auto, 1 = manual config C6, C7, C8 in effect)
Bit 7:      Timer off enabled

Sys config 2:
Bit 0:      Manual Defrost
Bit 1:      Reset to factory settings OR set Valve mode, you'll never know!
Bit 2:
```
